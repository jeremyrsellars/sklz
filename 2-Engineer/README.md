# Engineer

## Slogan
I have proven I have potential if I continue to better myself. I have become more independent. I know what it is like to work on a team. I must learn more!

## Expectations
Softek would like to see the engineer move to the next skill level once you have 4-5 years of experience. The engineer must move to the next skill level after 6 years of experience.
