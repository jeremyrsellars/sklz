## Senior Engineer â€“ Level 1

### Slogan
I am the bedrock of the Engineering organization. I represent the type of Engineering culture Softek encourages. A team of developers like me can produce amazing applications. I consider myself an owner of the entire product I work on, not just the portion I write. I am very independent. I seek familiarity with all aspects of product stack and life-cycle. I want to begin specializing in specific technologies.

### Expectations
Softek would like every engineer to reach this skill level. While Softek encourages engineers to progress to higher tiers, an engineer may choose to stay at this level for the remainder of their career.
