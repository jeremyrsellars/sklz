# Skill Levels

For Engineers

(todo: insert helpful picture here)

# Junior Engineer

## Slogan
I’ve coded for school and for fun, it is now time to begin my career as a developer. First things first, I must improve my skills and learn to work on a team.

## Expectations
Softek expects developers with less than 2 years of experience and/or straight out of college to start as a Junior Engineer. However, we would like to see you move to the next skill level within 2 years.

## Willingness to learn

The engineer tries to learn new things on a daily basis. The engineer can effectively learn through multiple methods, for example from others face-to-face, through reading articles, or by watching videos. This will benefit the engineer’s teammates as they need to spend less time helping the engineer.

# Effective Communication

The engineer can communicate information and ideas verbally and in written form. Communication is vital for integration with a team. When the engineer doesn’t understand something, they are able to explain the problem well enough that their team can help them.

# Engineer

## Slogan
I have proven I have potential if I continue to better myself. I have become more independent. I know what it is like to work on a team. I must learn more!

## Expectations
Softek would like to see the engineer move to the next skill level once you have 4-5 years of experience. The engineer must move to the next skill level after 6 years of experience.

# Senior Engineer – Level 1

## Slogan
I am the bedrock of the Engineering organization. I represent the type of Engineering culture Softek encourages. A team of developers like me can produce amazing applications. I consider myself an owner of the entire product I work on, not just the portion I write. I am very independent. I seek familiarity with all aspects of product stack and life-cycle. I want to begin specializing in specific technologies.

## Expectations
Softek would like every engineer to reach this skill level. While Softek encourages engineers to progress to higher tiers, an engineer may choose to stay at this level for the remainder of their career.
