# Junior Engineer

## Slogan
I’ve coded for school and for fun, it is now time to begin my career as a developer. First things first, I must improve my skills and learn to work on a team.

## Expectations
Softek expects developers with less than 2 years of experience and/or straight out of college to start as a Junior Engineer. However, we would like to see you move to the next skill level within 2 years.
