### Willingness to learn

The engineer tries to learn new things on a daily basis. The engineer can effectively learn through multiple methods, for example from others face-to-face, through reading articles, or by watching videos. This will benefit the engineerâ€™s teammates as they need to spend less time helping the engineer.
